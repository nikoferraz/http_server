This directory can be used to test the functionality of the HTTPServer.
It contains a diagram of the HTTPServer package in .png and and index.html file both of which can be used for testing purposes.
The log directory is available so the server can create a log file. If this directory is not present in the web root the server will only log to console.
For further information please refer to the HTTPServer_Documentation.pdf provided in HTTPServer_final_nferraz.zip
